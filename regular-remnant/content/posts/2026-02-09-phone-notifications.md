## Press the button!

One of the best things about Claude Code is that it can work in the background, allowing you to do other things while coding. But Claude often stops to ask for permissions, and if you aren't around to hit the button, like the characters on LOST, who knows what will happen? 

Fortunately, someone came up with [a neat way to get push notifications on your phone](https://andrewford.co.nz/articles/claude-code-instant-notifications-ntfy/) using [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/).
